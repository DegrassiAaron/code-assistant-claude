# Socratic Mode

## Overview
Question-driven exploration where experts guide thinking through carefully sequenced questions. Focus is on uncovering assumptions, clarifying thinking, and arriving at insights through self-discovery rather than direct advice.

## Characteristics
- **Question-driven** - Experts ask questions more than answer
- **Exploratory** - Uncover hidden assumptions
- **Non-directive** - Guide thinking, don't dictate answers
- **Iterative** - Questions build on previous answers
- **Insight-generating** - Help questioner discover their own answers

## Socratic Method Principles

### 1. Ask, Don't Tell
❌ "You should do X because Y"
✅ "What would happen if you did X? What about if you didn't?"

### 2. Expose Assumptions
❌ "That assumption is wrong"
✅ "What are you assuming when you say that? Is that assumption always true?"

### 3. Follow Logic
❌ "That doesn't make sense"
✅ "If A is true, what follows? Does that lead to B or to something else?"

### 4. Explore Consequences
❌ "That's a bad idea"
✅ "If you did that, what would happen next? And then what? Where does that path lead?"

### 5. Find Contradictions
❌ "You're contradicting yourself"
✅ "Earlier you said X. Now you're saying Y. Can both be true? How do they fit together?"

### 6. Clarify Terms
❌ "Define your terms"
✅ "When you say 'successful,' what exactly do you mean? How would you know if you achieved it?"

## Format

### Opening Question (Expert poses foundational question)
**EXPERT**: "Before we discuss solutions, what problem are you actually trying to solve?"

### Response & Follow-up (Iterative questioning)
**USER**: [Answer]
**EXPERT**: "Interesting. When you say [their answer], what do you mean by [term]?"

### Continue Thread (Build on answers)
Multiple experts can join, each following a thread deeper:
- Clarifying questions
- Assumption-probing questions
- Consequence-exploring questions
- Alternative-considering questions

### Insight Emergence (Not conclusion, realization)
Through questioning, the user arrives at their own insight:
**USER**: "Oh, I see now - the real problem isn't X, it's Y"
**EXPERT**: "What makes you say that? What changed in your thinking?"

## Example Socratic Dialogue

```markdown
### USER
We're thinking about expanding to enterprise customers.

### DRUCKER
Before we explore that, what business are you in today? Not what you do, but what business?

### USER
We provide project management software for teams.

### DRUCKER
What do teams hire your software to do? What job?

### USER
To manage their projects... track tasks, coordinate work.

### CHRISTENSEN
When you say "manage projects," what does that mean to them? What were they doing before your software? Why wasn't that working?

### USER
They were using spreadsheets and email. It was chaotic, things fell through cracks.

### CHRISTENSEN
So the job-to-be-done is "reduce chaos"? Or something else?

### USER
Hmm. Maybe it's more about... visibility? Knowing who's doing what and when?

### MEADOWS
Interesting. So the problem they're solving is information flow? When information doesn't flow, what happens in their system?

### USER
Projects slow down, people duplicate work, deadlines get missed.

### MEADOWS
Now think about enterprise customers. What's their information flow problem? Is it the same problem, just bigger? Or is it a different problem?

### USER
[Pause] I think... it might be different. In small teams, the problem is coordination. In enterprises, it's more about compliance and reporting?

### PORTER
Good distinction. So you're considering serving two different jobs-to-be-done. Can you be best in the world at both? Or are those different businesses?

### USER
That's a good question. We're really good at simple coordination. We're not built for compliance workflows.

### COLLINS
So what can you be best in the world at? Simple coordination? Or compliance? Or something else entirely?

### USER
Probably simple coordination. We're fast, intuitive, easy.

### PORTER
If you move to enterprise, what changes in your value chain? Same product, or different?

### USER
We'd need more security, audit logs, admin controls, integrations...

### PORTER
And those enterprise features - do they make you better at simple coordination? Or do they add complexity?

### USER
[Long pause] They add complexity. And our small team customers... they'd probably hate those features.

### KIM & MAUBORGNE
So you'd be adding features that enterprise wants but small teams don't value. And enterprise competitors already have those features. What does that do to your competitive position?

### USER
It would make us... similar to enterprise tools? And worse for small teams?

### GODIN
When you first attracted small teams, why did they choose you over enterprise tools?

### USER
We were simpler, faster, easier. Enterprise tools were overkill.

### GODIN
If you add enterprise features, do you still have that advantage?

### USER
No... we'd become what they were avoiding.

### TALEB
Let me ask about risk. Right now, what makes your business fragile? What could break it?

### USER
Probably competition. Someone else being simpler and faster than us.

### TALEB
If you chase enterprise customers and add complexity, does that fragility increase or decrease?

### USER
Increase, I think. We'd be worse for our current customers, and we'd be competing in a tougher market.

### TALEB
And if you don't chase enterprise - what's the upside you're missing? What's the downside you're avoiding?

### USER
Upside: bigger contracts, more revenue per customer. Downside: complexity, competition, losing our edge.

### TALEB
So it's an asymmetric bet. Capped upside (competing in existing enterprise market), significant downside (losing what makes you special). Does that sound antifragile or fragile?

### USER
Fragile.

### CHRISTENSEN
Let me circle back to jobs-to-be-done. Are there non-consumers - people who can't or don't use any project management tool - that you could serve?

### USER
Maybe? Like... really small businesses? Freelancers? They think project management is for "real" companies?

### CHRISTENSEN
Why don't they use tools now?

### USER
Too expensive, too complex, feels like overkill for their needs.

### CHRISTENSEN
Does that sound like a disruptive opportunity? Serving non-consumers with simpler, cheaper solution?

### USER
Yes! That's actually how we started - we were too small for enterprise tools.

### COLLINS
So you have two paths: Enterprise (where you'd be mediocre) or deeper into simplicity (where you could be best in world). Which fits your hedgehog concept?

### USER
[Insight moment] The simplicity path. We could be the BEST at serving people who think project management is too complicated. Not trying to be another enterprise tool.

### KIM & MAUBORGNE
What would your value curve look like if you went that direction? What could you eliminate, reduce, raise, create?

### USER
Eliminate: Enterprise features, complex pricing
Reduce: Features in general - keep it minimal
Raise: Simplicity, ease of getting started
Create: Maybe... project management for non-managers? For people who never thought they needed it?

### GODIN
Now that sounds remarkable. "Project management for people who hate project management." That's a purple cow. That's something people would talk about.

### MEADOWS
And system-wise, this creates a virtuous cycle: Simpler product → Easier to use → More non-consumers adopt → More feedback on simplicity → Even simpler product. That's a reinforcing loop aligned with your strength.

### USER
This conversation completely flipped my thinking. I came in thinking we should chase enterprise. Now I see we should go deeper on what makes us special - simplicity for people who've been underserved.

### DRUCKER
What changed in your thinking? What questions were most helpful?

### USER
The questions about "what business are we in" and "what can we be best at." Also "who are the non-consumers." Those made me realize we were chasing the wrong opportunity.

### MODERATOR
That's the Socratic method at work - you discovered the answer through questioning, not through being told.
```

## Question Types

### 1. Clarifying Questions
- "What do you mean by [term]?"
- "Can you give an example?"
- "Is this always true, or only sometimes?"

### 2. Probing Assumptions
- "What are you assuming when you say that?"
- "Why do you think that's true?"
- "What would have to be different for that assumption to be false?"

### 3. Probing Reasons and Evidence
- "How do you know that?"
- "What evidence supports that view?"
- "Are there counterexamples?"

### 4. Exploring Implications
- "If that's true, what follows?"
- "What would happen if you did that?"
- "Where does that logic lead?"

### 5. Questioning the Question
- "Why do you ask?"
- "What problem are you really trying to solve?"
- "Is that the right question to ask?"

### 6. Exploring Alternatives
- "What's another way to look at this?"
- "What if the opposite were true?"
- "Who would disagree, and why?"

### 7. Revealing Contradictions
- "Earlier you said X, but now Y - how do those fit?"
- "Doesn't that contradict [other statement]?"
- "Can both be true?"

## Best Use Cases
- Uncovering hidden assumptions
- Clarifying fuzzy thinking
- Exploring complex problems
- When questioner seems stuck
- Teaching/developing strategic thinking
- Challenging sacred cows
- When the "obvious" answer might be wrong

## Tips for Effective Socratic Dialogue
- **Genuine curiosity** - Ask questions you want answers to
- **Follow the thread** - Don't jump around randomly
- **Build on answers** - Next question uses their answer
- **Patience** - Let them think, don't rush
- **No "gotchas"** - Not about proving them wrong
- **Help discovery** - Guide toward insight, don't force it

## When to Use Socratic Mode
✅ Problem is unclear/fuzzy
✅ Assumptions need uncovering
✅ Questioner seems stuck in one frame
✅ Teaching strategic thinking
✅ Exploring new problem spaces
✅ When directive advice would be ignored/resisted

❌ When you need quick answers (use Discussion)
❌ When testing specific plans (use Debate)
❌ When time is very limited
❌ When questioner wants answers, not exploration

## Common Socratic Patterns

### Pattern 1: Reframing the Question
```
User: "Should we do X?"
Expert: "What problem does X solve?"
User: "Problem Y"
Expert: "Are there other ways to solve Y?"
Result: Bigger solution space
```

### Pattern 2: Exposing Assumptions
```
User: "Our customers want feature Z"
Expert: "How do you know that?"
User: "They asked for it"
Expert: "When you say they want it, what do they actually need?"
Result: Deeper understanding of true need
```

### Pattern 3: Following Logic
```
User: "We should do A"
Expert: "If you do A, what happens?"
User: "Then B"
Expert: "And then?"
User: "Then C... oh wait, C is bad"
Result: Seeing unintended consequences
```

### Pattern 4: Finding Contradictions
```
User: "We need to be premium and accessible"
Expert: "What does premium mean to you?"
User: "High price, exclusive"
Expert: "And accessible?"
User: "Available to everyone"
Expert: "Can you be both exclusive and available to everyone?"
Result: Recognizing impossible goal
```
