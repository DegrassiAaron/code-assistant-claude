# Discussion Mode

## Overview
Collaborative exploration where experts build on each other's insights to develop a comprehensive understanding. Focus is on convergence toward shared insights and actionable recommendations.

## Characteristics
- **Collaborative** - Experts build on each other's ideas
- **Constructive** - Find common ground and synthesis
- **Comprehensive** - Cover multiple perspectives
- **Convergent** - Work toward unified recommendations

## Format

### Round 1: Initial Perspectives (2-3 minutes each)
Each expert provides their initial analysis from their framework:
- **[EXPERT NAME]**: [Their perspective]
- Focus on their unique lens
- No debate yet, just sharing views

### Round 2: Building Connections (3-4 minutes)
Experts identify:
- **Points of agreement** - Where frameworks align
- **Complementary insights** - How views strengthen each other
- **Integrated analysis** - Combining multiple lenses

Examples:
- "Building on [EXPERT]'s point about..."
- "This connects to what [EXPERT] said about..."
- "From my framework, this reinforces..."

### Round 3: Synthesis (2-3 minutes)
Group develops:
- **Unified analysis** - Integrated perspective
- **Key insights** - Most important takeaways
- **Actionable recommendations** - What to do

## Moderator Role
- Facilitates orderly sharing
- Highlights connections between experts
- Guides toward synthesis
- Ensures all voices heard
- Manages time

## Example Discussion Flow

```markdown
### MODERATOR
We're examining the question: "Should we expand into the cloud storage market?"

Let's hear initial perspectives. Porter, let's start with competitive analysis.

### PORTER
From a Five Forces perspective, this market shows HIGH competitive rivalry and HIGH buyer power, making it structurally unattractive. However, a focused differentiation strategy targeting a specific vertical could work...

### CHRISTENSEN
I'd add that this looks like potential disruption opportunity. The incumbents (AWS, Google, Microsoft) are focused on enterprise customers. If we target non-consumers - those intimidated by complexity - with radically simpler solution...

### PORTER
That aligns with my recommendation for focused strategy. Christensen's jobs-to-be-done lens helps identify which segment to target.

### KIM & MAUBORGNE
Exactly. We could create blue ocean by eliminating features that enterprise customers value but intimidate regular users. Our ERRC grid would eliminate enterprise features, reduce complexity, raise simplicity, create trust...

### MEADOWS
I'm seeing a systems pattern here. The industry has a reinforcing loop: More features → More complexity → Serves enterprise better → More features. We could create a balancing loop: Simplicity → Serves regular users → Word of mouth → More simple users → Pressure to stay simple.

### GODIN
From a marketing standpoint, this is perfect. Don't try to out-feature Amazon. Be the "anti-cloud" - radically simple, trustworthy, for normal people. That's a purple cow. That's remarkable.

### MODERATOR
I'm hearing convergence around a strategy. Let's synthesize.

### SYNTHESIS
**Unified Recommendation**: Enter market with focused differentiation strategy

**Strategic Elements** (Integrated from multiple frameworks):
1. **Target**: Non-consumers intimidated by current options (Christensen)
2. **Position**: Blue ocean through simplicity (Kim/Mauborgne)
3. **Competitive**: Focused differentiation, not cost leadership (Porter)
4. **Marketing**: "Anti-cloud" - remarkable simplicity (Godin)
5. **System**: Design reinforcing loop around simplicity (Meadows)

**Specific Actions**:
- Identify "jobs-to-be-done" for non-consumers
- ERRC analysis to create value curve
- Focus on one vertical (e.g., journalists, activists)
- Premium pricing justified by simplicity + trust
- Community-driven growth (tribe building)
- Measure system health (simplicity metrics)

**Success Criteria**:
- Different value curve than incumbents
- Sustainable competitive advantage
- Attracts non-consumers
- Creates movement, not just customers
```

## Best Use Cases
- Strategic planning
- Problem-solving requiring multiple perspectives
- Situations needing comprehensive analysis
- When synthesis and action items are priority
- Building consensus

## Tips for Effective Discussion
- **Select 3-5 experts** - Enough diversity, not overwhelming
- **Choose complementary frameworks** - Different lenses, not redundant
- **Allow building** - Let experts reference each other
- **Guide synthesis** - Help connect dots between perspectives
- **Action-oriented** - End with clear next steps

## When to Use Discussion Mode
✅ Strategic planning
✅ Complex problem-solving
✅ Need comprehensive analysis
✅ Building shared understanding
✅ Developing action plans

❌ When you need to stress-test ideas (use Debate)
❌ When exploring fundamental questions (use Socratic)
❌ When time is very limited (use individual expert)
