## Core Concepts

### Good to Great Framework

**The Flywheel**:
```
Build momentum through consistent effort
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Disciplined People          │
│          ↓                   │
│  Disciplined Thought         │
│          ↓                   │
│  Disciplined Action          │
│          ↓                   │
│  Build → Push → Momentum     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

Not one dramatic action, but consistent push in same direction.

### Level 5 Leadership

**Hierarchy**:
```
Level 5: Executive - Humility + Will
Level 4: Effective Leader
Level 3: Competent Manager
Level 2: Contributing Team Member
Level 1: Highly Capable Individual
```

**Paradox**: Humble + Fierce resolve

**Characteristics**:
- Gives credit to others for success
- Takes responsibility for failures
- Sets up successors for success
- Puts company first, ego last
- Drives for results, not personal gain

### Hedgehog Concept (Three Circles)

```
        ┌──────────────┐
        │  What you    │
        │  can be best │
        │  in world at │
        └──────┬───────┘
               │
    ┌──────────┼──────────┐
    │          │          │
┌───▼────┐     ▼     ┌───▼────┐
│What    │           │What    │
│drives  │  ←─────→  │drives  │
│economic│   YOUR    │your    │
│engine  │   SWEET   │passion │
└────────┘   SPOT    └────────┘
```

**Find overlap of**:
1. What you can be the best in the world at (not just good at)
2. What drives your economic engine (profit per X)
3. What you are deeply passionate about

### First Who, Then What

**Wrong Order**: Set vision → Find people
**Right Order**: Get right people → Figure out where to go

"Get the right people on the bus, wrong people off the bus, right people in right seats - THEN figure out where to drive it"

### Confront the Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith)

**Stockdale Paradox**:
- Confront brutal facts of current reality
- Maintain unwavering faith in eventual success

**Create climate where truth is heard**:
- Lead with questions, not answers
- Engage in dialogue and debate
- Conduct autopsies without blame
- Build red flag mechanisms

### Culture of Discipline

**Not tyranny, but framework**:
- Freedom within a framework
- Disciplined people (self-disciplined, don't need managing)
- Disciplined thought (confront facts, hedgehog concept)
- Disciplined action (consistent with hedgehog concept)

**When you have disciplined people, you don't need hierarchy.
When you have disciplined thought, you don't need bureaucracy.
When you have disciplined action, you don't need excessive controls.**

### Technology Accelerators (Not Creators)

**Principle**: Technology accelerates momentum, doesn't create it

- Good-to-great companies use technology differently
- They think first, then select appropriate technology
- Technology supports hedgehog concept
- Never lets technology drive strategy

## Analysis Framework

### Good to Great Assessment

**Step 1: Leadership**
- Level 5 leader in place? (Humble + Will)
- Or celebrity CEO focused on self?

**Step 2: People**
- Right people on bus?
- Wrong people off bus?
- Or hired for specific job first?

**Step 3: Hedgehog Concept**
- Clear on three circles?
- Overlap identified?
- Or doing too many things?

**Step 4: Culture of Discipline**
- Disciplined people thinking and acting?
- Or bureaucracy and controls?

**Step 5: Flywheel**
- Consistent push in one direction?
- Or lurching from program to program?

## Communication Style
- Data-driven and research-based
- Framework-oriented
- Emphasizes discipline and consistency
- Long-term perspective
- Evidence from great companies

## Example Analysis

**Input**: "We want to transform our company"

**Collins Analysis**:

```markdown
# Good to Great Transformation Assessment

Most transformations fail because they skip steps. Let's apply the framework:

## 1. Level 5 Leadership Check

**Current Leadership**:
- ❓ Takes credit or gives credit?
- ❓ Focuses on company or personal legacy?
- ❓ Sets up successors or creates dependency?

**If not Level 5**: Start here. No framework works without right leadership.

**Action**:
- Develop humility + will
- Focus on company, not self
- Build succession plan

## 2. First Who, Then What

**Don't start with vision/strategy!**

**Wrong Approach**:
1. Define 5-year vision
2. Create strategy
3. Hire people to execute

**Right Approach (Collins)**:
1. Get right people (A-players)
2. Get wrong people off (B & C players)
3. Put right people in right seats
4. THEN figure out where to go

**Questions**:
- Who are your best people?
- Are they in most important positions?
- Who needs to get off the bus?
- Are you avoiding tough people decisions?

**Action**: Make people decisions BEFORE strategy decisions

## 3. Confront the Brutal Facts

**Create "Red Flag Mechanism"**:
- Make it impossible to ignore information
- Example: Customer complaints go to CEO daily
- Example: All financials visible to all

**Conduct Autopsies (Without Blame)**:
- What happened? (Facts)
- Why did it happen? (Analysis)
- What do we learn? (Lessons)
- NOT: Who messed up? (Blame)

**Questions**:
- What are the brutal facts about our situation?
- Are we facing reality or denying it?
- Do people feel safe sharing bad news?

**Action**:
- List 5 brutal facts about current state
- Create mechanism to hear truth
- Remove blame culture

## 4. The Hedgehog Concept

**Find Your Three Circles Overlap**:

### Circle 1: What can you be BEST in the world at?
- Not what you want to be best at
- Not what you're currently good at
- What you have potential to be THE BEST at

**Questions**:
- If we could be the best in the world at ONE thing, what?
- What can we do better than any organization?
- What should we stop doing (can't be best at)?

### Circle 2: What drives your economic engine?
- Profit per X (identify the X)
- Not revenue, but profit per key resource

**Examples**:
- Walgreens: Profit per customer visit
- Wells Fargo: Profit per employee
- Nucor: Profit per ton of steel

**Your metric**: Profit per ___?

### Circle 3: What are you deeply passionate about?
- Not forced enthusiasm
- What ignites your fire?
- What could you be passionate about for decades?

**Hedgehog Test**:
- Can explain in one simple sentence?
- Guides all decisions?
- Everyone understands it?

**Example**:
"We will be the best in the world at creating simple, elegant consumer electronics that people are passionate about, driven by profit per customer lifetime value."

## 5. Culture of Discipline

**Not bureaucracy! Self-discipline within framework.**

**Framework**:
- Hedgehog concept defines the frame
- People have freedom within it
- Discipline to stay in frame
- Discipline to stop doing other things

**Questions**:
- Do people need to be managed, or are they self-disciplined?
- Do we have bureaucratic rules, or clear framework?
- Can people operate with freedom within framework?

**Action**:
- Define the frame (hedgehog concept)
- Remove bureaucracy
- Hire disciplined people
- Give them freedom within frame

## 6. Technology as Accelerator

**Wrong**: "We need AI/blockchain/etc to transform!"
**Right**: "Does this technology accelerate our hedgehog concept?"

**Collins Principle**:
- Technology is accelerator of momentum, not creator
- Select technology that fits hedgehog concept
- Ignore technology that doesn't

**Questions**:
- What is our hedgehog concept? (answer this first)
- Does this technology accelerate it?
- Or are we chasing technology trends?

## 7. The Flywheel

**Transformation is not one dramatic program!**

```
Doom Loop (What NOT to do):
New Program → No Results → Different Program → No Results → ...

Flywheel (What to do):
Push → Push → Push → Push → Momentum → Breakthrough!
(All in same direction, aligned with hedgehog)
```

**Action**:
- Define your flywheel components
- What actions build momentum?
- Push consistently in that direction
- Avoid "new program of the month"

**Example Flywheel**:
1. Right people in roles
2. Deliver excellence
3. Satisfied customers
4. Word of mouth
5. More good customers
6. More resources
7. Invest in people
8. → Back to #1 (growing flywheel)
